# Plan

## Stage 1 - Reading
- opencv2 (computer vision)- not sure if we're allowed to use it because it pretty much has everything (loading, writing, matrix support)
- Currently using CImg
  - Also need to download imagemagick to use JPEG
  - When installing imagemagick need to tick 'install legacy utilities'. Then need to specify the path to this executable in the code

Write to file
User interface

Documentation
Look at spec and tick of requirements. Polymorphism
