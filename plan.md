# Plan

## Stage 1 - Reading
- opencv2 (computer vision)- not sure if we're allowed to use it because it pretty much has everything (loading, writing, matrix support)
- Currently using CImg
  - Also need to download imagemagick to use JPEG
  - When installing imagemagick need to tick 'install legacy utilities'. Then need to specify the path to this executable in the code
